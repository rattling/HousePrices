Kaggle Challenge

The idea of this project is to build the modelling approach and implementation from the ground up.  Start with the most basic model and only add to and alter it, step by step in a reasoned fashion.  Starting with Regression, then will move to tree-based methods and so on.  Will also improve code as I go, creating my own functions for repetitive tasks and possibly for re-use in other projects.  

Once I've squeezed all the juice out of this approach, will start looking more at the top scoring kernels to see where I can improve. That way I build up my own skillset and intuitions and internalize the approaches from the big boys rather than just copy and paste big chunks of code. (Still plenty of room for copying and pasting small chunks of code when it makes sense!)
